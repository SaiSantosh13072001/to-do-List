2- Editing Tasks

-Here there are two options where we can edit or delete the task or to-do task that you insert in the to-do list.
-Each task comes with an Edit button, enabling users to modify task details.
-This allows flexibility to update tasks as needed.

3- Deleting Tasks

-Then once the task is done or complete you delete the task as well from the task list by clicking the delete button.
-Once a task is completed or no longer needed, users can remove it using the Delete button.
-This ensures the list remains clean and up to date.

Example Use Case
Then by clicking the edit option, I changed the task description from the to-do task list.

A user adds a task: "Wish Happy Birthday to Radhika."
